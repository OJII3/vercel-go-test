# vercel go test

I don't know how to test this locally, but it works on vercel.

- <https://vercel-go-nine.vercel.app/> (public/index.html)
- <https://vercel-go-nine.vercel.app/api/hello> (api/hello.go)
- <https://vercel-go-nine.vercel.app/api/index> (api/index.go)

I think vercel deals with the most of the things, so I don't know much about build, test, deploy, etc.

The only thing I do is to push the code to github.
